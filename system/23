1. ssh to your vm: ssh user@ip-address
2. create a new user with a home directory: sudo useradd -m username
3. next add your ssh-key to the new user:
    Create the folder if it doesn't already exist:

    mkdir /home/$USER/.ssh

    Make the directory only executable by the user:

    chmod 700 /home/$USER/.ssh

    Copy the authorized_keys file that contains your public key:

    sudo cp /root/.ssh/authorized_keys /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys

    Make everything in .ssh owned by your user:

    sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /home/$USER/.ssh

    Make it readable only by your user:

    sudo chmod 600 /home/$USER/.ssh/authorized_keys

4. exit the ssh session: exit
5. copy the ssh-key from your local machine: ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub new-user@ip-address
5. connect again as the new user: ssh new-user@ip-address
6. done
